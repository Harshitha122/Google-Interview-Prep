You are given an integer array nums and a non-negative integer k. A sequence of integers seq is called good if there are at most k indices i in the range [0, seq.length - 2] such that seq[i] != seq[i + 1].

Return the maximum possible length of a good subsequence of nums.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,1,1,3], k = 2

Output: 4

Explanation:

The maximum length subsequence is [1,2,1,1,3].


Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,1], k = 0

Output: 2

Explanation:

The maximum length subsequence is [1,2,3,4,5,1].


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 500
	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
	0 <= k <= min(nums.length, 25)
